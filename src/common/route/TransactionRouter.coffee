# Defines the TransactionRouter class which routes transaction requests to
# transaction handlers. This is convenient because the requesting object
# need-not-know which object is fulfilling its request.

# The TransactionRouter class defines a routerÂ capable of routing transaction
# requests to transaction handlers, which should always return a Promise
# object. This decouples the requesters from the request-fulfiller, so both
# can be tested independently.

  # TransactionRouter constructor which takes no arguments.

  ##
  # Adds a transaction handler to this router. Each handler must be paired
  # with a matcher function which determines if the associated handler should
  # be passed this request. Each transaction request is only routed to at-most
  # one handler. Users should not assume that routes remain ordered, that is
  # transaction requests should remain unique enough that it is not ambiguous
  # as-to which handler will handle the request.
  #
  # @param {function} matcher - Matching function used to determine if a routed
  # transaction should be passed to this handler.
  #
  # @param {function} handler - Transaction handler function.
